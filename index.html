                    <p>Hello, I am Jack Boland. I am a UX/UI designer based in Texas. I hope to help as many users as possible with their online experiences. 
                        I see countless areas of improvement all the time, and to think that some people are having their days ruined by these imperfections makes me happy to help when I can. 
                        I believe my work can make a positive impact on the users that I come across whilst designing.</p>
                    <p>In 2022, I graduated with an Associate's in Video Game Development.
                        In my time spent learning, I also noticed the many intricacies of UX/UI
                        and its importance in creating a unique game play experience for the players.
                        Some key skills I have learned through game development include
                        prioritizing user enjoyment, finding unique solutions to unique problems,
                        and creating an aesthetic that fits the narrative as well as product testing.</p>
                    <p>I love the idea of using my game development background and the
                        learning of UX\UI design for the deveolpment of new apps and websites
                        particularly with gaming.</p>
                    <p>Why UX/UI?
                        While pursuing my video game development degree, I learned that I really
                        enjoy programming and unique problem solving. I have come to
                        immensely enjoy finding out ways in which an experience can be improved
                        as well as seeing the work come to life. I enjoy creating a more efficient
                        and pleasant experience for any person who happens to come across
                        my work. The program with UT at Austin was a great opportunity
                        to move into a more User friendly experience.</p>
